/**
 * Algorithms are used to compute properties on graphs or graph elements. These
 * properties could be a measure, color, spanning tree, etc... Algorithms are
 * divided into two steps :
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>initialization, that initialize or reset the algorithm ;</li>
 * <li>computation, that computes a property or updates a previous result.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Algorithm interface aims to define algorithms that do no handle dynamics of
 * the graph, whereas algorithms implementing the
 * {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.DynamicAlgorithm} interface (an extended
 * version of Algorithm) are able to handle this dynamics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This following is an example of an algorithm that computes max, min and
 * average degrees of a graph:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * public class DegreesAlgorithm implements Algorithm {
 * 		Graph theGraph;
 * 		int minDegree, maxDegree, avgDegree;
 * 
 * 		public void init(Graph graph) {
 * 			theGraph = graph; 
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public void compute() {
 * 			avgDegree = 0;
 * 			minDegree = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
 * 			maxDegree = 0;
 * 
 * 			for(Node n : theGraph.getEachNode() ) {
 * 				int deg = n.getDegree();
 * 
 * 				minDegree = Math.min(minDegree, d);
 * 				maxDegree = Math.max(maxDegree, d);
 * 				avgDegree += d;
 * 			}
 * 
 * 			avgDegree /= theGraph.getNodeCount();
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public int getMaxDegree() {
 * 			return maxDegree;
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public int getMinDegree() {
 * 			return minDegree;
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		public int getAverageDegree() {
 * 			return avgDegree;
 * 		}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Complexity of algorithms can be specify in the documentation with the help of
 * the "@complexity" tag.
 * </p>
